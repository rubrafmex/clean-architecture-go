# Clean Architecture GO
My Implementation of clean architecture in GOLang. 

## Building
Like Every Go application you can just run the following command to fetch the code
```
go get github.com/rubrafmex/clean-architecture-go
```
This will fetch the code in `$GOPATH//src/github.com/rubrafmex/clean-architecture-go` 
from inside the `./src` folder run the build command to build the code
```
go build
```

## Running the server
To run the server just execute the build binary
```
./clean-architecture-go
```

## Todo
- [x] Add Mux Router
- [x] Add Pluggable Logger  
- [x] Add Mongo DB
- [ ] Write Test Cases
- [ ] Implement dot Env
